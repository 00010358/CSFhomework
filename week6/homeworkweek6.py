# test if 'c' is lowercase, which it is. Telling us that there are lowercase 
# letters in the string when clearly there are not.

# False which implies that there were no lowercase letters in the string, which

# that comes across a lowercase letter the condition 'flag' becomes:
# False or True which results in 'flag' being set to True. Once 'flag' is 
# reassigned, no lower- or uppercase letter can change 'flag' back to False.
